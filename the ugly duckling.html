  <h2> The Ugly Duckling </h2>
  <h3> Hans Christian Andersenâ€™s tale The Ugly Duckling is a famous story world-round. The real version has the little chick originally harassed incessantly by the other barnyard animals. He escapes and lives with wild geese and ducks who are soon slaughtered by hunters. An old woman takes him in, but her cat and hen harass him even more so he leaves again. After much abuse and spending winter alone, he joins the swans who return in spring.</h3>
