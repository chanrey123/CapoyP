  <h2> Cinderella </h2>
  <h3> In Disney's version of this fairy tale, Cinderella is stuck living with her evil stepmother and stepsisters after her father dies, forced to be their servant. With the help of a fairy godmother, she manages to go to a ball one day and meet a handsome prince.
<br>
After the ball, the prince searches his kingdom for the mysterious beauty, his only clue being a glass slipper she left behind.
<br>
But when his entourage gets to Cinderella's house, the evil stepmother locks the girl up and prods Cinderella's stepsisters to get their feet into the shoe.
<br>
Now, here’s how Disney wrote the ending: the sisters' meaty feet simply won't slide into the delicate slipper, Cinderella breaks free, proves that she's the mysterious girl and she and the prince get married.
<br>
In the Grimms' version, Cinderella leads a similarly dreadful life, constantly oppressed by her stepsisters, except for one troubling difference: her father is still alive and doesn't do anything to protect her from their torments. Great guy.
<br>
And when the prince arrives at their house with the shoe, one stepsister wants the prince so badly that she cuts off her toe while the other sister slices off a piece of her heel to get into the slipper.
<br>
But the prince can't be fooled. And when the stepsisters defeatedly show up at Cinderella’s wedding, two birds come and pluck the young ladies’ eyes out. The end.</h3>
