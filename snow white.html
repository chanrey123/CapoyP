  <h2> Snow White </h2>
  <h3> In disney movie from 1973, a wicked queen feels threatened by Snow Whiteâ€™s beauty and gives her a poisoned apple, putting a deathlike spell on her.
But a prince who has become infatuated with the young lady comes to her rescue and kisses her, freeing her from the curse.
<br>
In both the versions by Disney and the Grimm brothers, the evil queen is assigned a cruel fate: In the film, she falls off a cliff and greedy vultures follow her to pick at her dead body.
<br>
But in the Grimms' Schneewittchen - "Little Snow White" - the wicked lady has to suffer longer. She goes to Snow White's wedding and is forced to put on red-hot shoes and dance until she dies.</h3>
